Ver 0.7.3
Adapted to work with QGIS 3. Works with Python 3.x and QT5, which required quite a few minor changes.
Download and installation of Python3/MySQLdb binaries required.

---Ver. 0.6
Changed dialog settings for loading the CRS Selector Widget under Windows and Mac
Provide additional instructions for installing the MySQL/Python extensions

---Vers. 0.5
Fixed plugin loading under Windows and Mac
Added message to make sure the MySQL/Python plugins are installed

---Vers. 0.4

Fixed MySQL/MariaDB port setting, if it is not default 3306
Fixed importing multiple files after each other, where "Select File" button was disabled

---Vers. 0.3

Fixed button functions when using the plugin several times within the same QGIS session to import one file after the other -> the button click functions were moved to initGui

Added: The user can now also choose the CRS (coordinate reference system) for the imported tables. Defaulted to ESPG:4326 previously

---Vers. 0.2
 
The OK button is initially disabled and will only be enabled if a file is selected for import.

The database connection parameters will now also be checked (same as with the "Test Connection" button) before the import starts and an error shown if something is wrong.
