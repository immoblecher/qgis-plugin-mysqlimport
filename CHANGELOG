Fixed button functions when using the plugin several times within the same QGIS session to import one file after the other -> the button click funtions were moved to initGui

Added: The user can now also choose the CRS (coordinate reference system) for the imported tables. Defaulted to ESPG:4326 previously

The OK button is initially disabled and will only be enabled if a file is selected for import.

The database connection parameters will now also be checked (same as with the "Test Connection" button) before the import starts and an error shown if something is wrong.
